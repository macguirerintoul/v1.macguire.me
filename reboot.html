			<h3>Why</h3>
			<p>Since I was a child, I have been interested in computers and technology. I spent much of my free time using them, playing games, discovering how they work. As I grew older, friends and family began to know me by my knowledge, and I was able to help them with most problems they had. Any problem I didn’t already know how to solve could be fixed with research – understanding the context and ontology of the problems was key to being able to do anything about them.</p>

				</figure>
			<p>My first two years at SFU developed my branding and visual design skills, and I decided to pair them with my entrepreneurial drive and tech skills to create a saleable service.</p>
			<p>I ideated tens of logos and names related to the tech industry, specifically layman’s terms. Due to the demand of the service and there being virtually no barrier to enter the industry, many were already taken. I decided on Reboot Tech, since it was a familiar concept to (hopefully) everybody who has ever used a device. I came up with the logo using the shape of a switch with I and O printed on it, a universal symbol for on and off. Turning the switch sideways and controlling the slight curve that most switches have, I created a lighthearted winking face to set a calmer mood than the stress that customers may have from malfunctioning devices.</p>
			<p>From an information design perspective, in order to attract the most business, I needed potential customers to know the breadth of services Reboot Tech offered. Using a scrollable landing page WordPress theme, I provided an overview, a list of devices, and a list of services. The website gave potential customers everything they needed to decide whether or not they would hire me.</p>
